# OVERVIEW
I am creating a GitHub section to store my Generative Artificial Intelligence ("GenAI") work from both Certificates & Personal projects.

Please find below descriptions of the folders where you may find certain documents:
- <b>GenAI with Large Language Models</b> | [Link]([https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms](https://github.com/sobcza11/GenAI/tree/main/GenAI%20Engineering))
	- AWS & DeepLearning.AI 
	- I <b>initiated my exploration of GenAI</b> with this course to establish a comprehensive macro-level understanding before delving into more intricate technical components. 
- <b>IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate</b> | [Link](https://github.com/sobcza11/GenAI/blob/main/GenAI%20Engineering/Certificates/16.%20IBM%20Generative%20AI%20Engineering%20Professional%20Certificate.pdf)
	- IBM Course
	- This program provides <b>an in-depth examination of the foundational & advanced mechanisms underlying Artificial Intelligence</b>, offering a granular perspective on its core methodologies.
- <b>Personal projects</b>
