# Projects
This is a living archive of my <b>Generative AI work</b> — a curated portfolio where experimentation meets execution, and ideas evolve into tangible outcomes. Each project reflects not only what I’m building, but what I’m learning along the way.

My journey in the data world is rooted in <b>curiosity</b> and driven by <b>consistency</b>. As I explore the capabilities of <b>language models</b>, retrieval-augmented generation, and intelligent agents, this space will grow — documenting the insights, <b>breakthroughs</b>, and even the occasional misstep that shape my path.

Consider this both a <b>record and a roadmap</b> — <b>an evolving showcase of how data and creativity intersect</b>..
