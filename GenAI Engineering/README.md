# IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate | 16 Courses

Welcome to the culmination of a journey that’s been both technically challenging and personally transformative. What began with foundational courses in Python and AI quickly evolved into building full-scale generative AI applications using some of the most in-demand frameworks in industry—LangChain, Hugging Face, and IBM Watsonx.

---

### 🧠 The Path to AI Engineering

The program began by demystifying **Artificial Intelligence**, helping me understand its transformative power, real-world applications, and ethical dimensions. From there, I dived into **Python for Data Science**, mastering foundational coding skills, data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy, and even accessing web data through APIs and BeautifulSoup.

In **Machine Learning with Python**, I learned how to preprocess data, balance bias and variance, and build powerful models like linear regression, SVMs, and decision trees using `scikit-learn`. This naturally led to **Deep Learning with Keras**, where I built CNNs, RNNs, and autoencoders to solve more complex problems.

### 🔁 From Learning to Creating

The second half of the journey brought me into the world of **Generative AI**. I developed:

- A strong foundation in **Prompt Engineering**
- An understanding of **LLM architectures** (e.g., GPT, BERT, Transformers, Diffusion Models)
- Practical experience in **fine-tuning LLMs** with PEFT techniques like LoRA & QLoRA
- Experience using **Flask** and **Gradio** to build real-world model interfaces

I also learned how to create NLP pipelines and perform advanced tokenization using tools like **PyTorch**, **spaCy**, and **Transformers**.

### 🔍 Applied GenAI with LangChain & RAG

This journey culminated in a capstone project housed in the [**Notebooks**](./Notebooks) folder. Here, I designed and deployed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using LangChain, IBM Watsonx, and a vector database to query complex PDFs through natural language—making academic research *searchable and explainable*.

> A full PDF is downloaded, parsed, embedded, and queried through a chatbot interface—answering user questions in-context.
