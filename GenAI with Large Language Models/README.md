# OVERVIEW
In the Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs) course 
[Generative AI with LLMs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms/paidmedia?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=b2c_namer_generative-ai-with-llms_deeplearning-ai_ftcof_learn_px_dr_bau_gg_sem_pr-bd_us-ca_en_m_hyb_23-09_x&campaignid=20534248984&adgroupid=155736976280&device=c&keyword=generative%20ai%20with%20large%20language%20models&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&creativeid=673252278896&assetgroupid=&targetid=kwd-2259390252437&extensionid=&placement=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp8--BhBREiwAj7og1328xOflXcEt-MdQtpHtfDFP0n9UslTWr7yaTv0Q8Xb33Gk9_J4ObBoCX_sQAvD_BwE), 
I gained a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles behind generative AI & how to effectively deploy it in real-world applications.

<b>- Comprehend the generative AI lifecycle:</b> I developed a deep understanding of the key stages involved in an LLM-based generative AI workflowâ€”ranging from data collection & model selection to performance evaluation & deployment.

<b>- Analyze transformer architecture:</b> I learned the intricate details of the transformer architecture that underpins LLMs, including their training processes & how fine-tuning enables adaptation to diverse, domain-specific use cases.

<b>- Optimize model performance:</b> I applied empirical scaling laws to optimize the model's objective function by balancing dataset size, computational resources, & inference efficiency.
Implement advanced techniques:</b> I explored state-of-the-art methods for training, tuning, inference, & deployment, ensuring model performance is maximized while meeting project-specific constraints.

<b>- Evaluate business implications:</b> I assessed the opportunities & challenges generative AI presents for businesses, informed by insights from industry experts & real-world case studies.

This intermediate-level course required prior experience in Python programming, which I possessed, along with a solid foundation in machine learning concepts, including supervised & unsupervised learning, loss functions, & the partitioning of data into training, validation, & test sets.
